We live today in a world that is so very different from the one we grew up in, the one we were educated in. The world today is changing at such an accelerated rate and we as were educators need to pause and reflect on this entire system of Education. Are our schools well equipped to prepare our children to face the challengers that the future holds?

Each issue of our school magazine is a milestone that marks our growth, unfolds our imaginations, and gives life to our thoughts and aspirations. It unleashes a wide spectrum of creative skills ranging from writing to editing and even in designing the magazine. I congratulate the entire editorial team for their hard work and dedication in making this dream come true.
A committed and supportive management, dedicated teachers, caring and co-operative parents blend harmoniously to create a child centric school. It is natural to find in this ambience, the intensive use of a variety of thinking activities, strategies and group dynamics so that the classrooms become alive. Teamwork is the hallmark of MSCA. I am very sure through collaborative effort we can achieve more to benefit our students who are future leaders of tomorrow.

                        <p>Questions such as these are factors that motivate us to go through a continuous process of reflection and hence we at MSCA work at implementing a well balanced curriculum to ensure that the children who walk into the portals of our schools will not just love their school years but truly be prepared to face life&apos;s challenges. 
It was Margaret Mead who said &quot;Children must be taught how to think, not what to thik,&quot; and to enable this, our motto Light the Lamp of Knowledge is encouraged through a holistic approach. &quot;TO MOTIVATE THE WEAK TO ADDRESS THE AVERAGE AND CHALLENGE THE GIFTED&quot; is the teaching vision of our school. </p>

                        <p>Aristotle once said that, &quot;Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.&quot; Even as we impart education to match the advancement in technology and globalization, we march our children ahead with MSCA&apos; ethos of moral values and principles. We endeavour constantly to instill these qualities in our children. We pride ourselves to help them grow and develop into sensitive and responsible citizen of the next generation.
