It unleashes a wide spectrum of creative skills ranging from writing to editing and even in designing the magazine. I congratulate the entire editorial team for their hard work and dedication in making this dream come true. A committed and supportive management, dedicated teachers, caring and co-operative parents blend harmoniously to create a child centric school. It is natural to find in this ambience, the intensive use of a variety of thinking activities, strategies and group dynamics so that the classrooms become alive. Teamwork is the hallmark of MSCA. I am very sure through collaborative effort we can achieve more to benefit our students who are future leaders of tomorrow.</p>
